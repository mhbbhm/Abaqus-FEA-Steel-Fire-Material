## Introduction

The script computes parameters such as elastic modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, ultimate strain, and stress-strain data for steel subjected to varying temperatures. These properties are important for analyzing the behavior of steel structures under different thermal conditions.

## Installation

To run this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the NumPy and Pandas libraries. You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy pandas
